# Questions and Answers

## Is React code working with Next.js?

Yes, React code can work with Next.js. Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides additional features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing.

## What is Component?

In React, a component is a reusable piece of UI that can be composed together to create more complex UIs. Components can be either functional or class-based, and can accept input data (called "props") and maintain internal state.

## How to pass data in component?

To pass data to a component in React, you can use "props". Props are input data that are passed from a parent component to a child component. Here's an example of how to pass data to a child component:

```
// Parent component
function App() {
  const name = "John";
  return <ChildComponent name={name} />;
}

// Child component
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}
```

In this example, the `name` variable is passed to the `ChildComponent` as a prop.

## Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript?

JavaScript is a dynamically typed scripting language that is used primarily for client-side scripting in web browsers. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features such as interfaces and classes. TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript before it is executed by a web browser or server.

## Server Side Scripting vs Client Side Scripting?

Server-side scripting refers to code that is executed on a web server in response to a client request. Examples of server-side scripting languages include PHP, Python, and Ruby. Client-side scripting refers to code that is executed on the client's web browser after the web page has been loaded. Examples of client-side scripting languages include JavaScript and TypeScript.
